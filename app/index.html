      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        <strong>I am a child of St. Paul</strong> – I live in the Como neighborhood, and I’ve spent most of my life here. I attended
        MMSA, Central High School, and the University of Minnesota Humphrey School. I also hold a PhD in political
        science from UW-Madison. Currently, I serve our community as a board member of the St. Paul Central Foundation
        and as co-founder of the Twin Cities Front Yard Organic Gardener’s Club.
      </p>
      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        I’m running for council because I’m concerned that the current brand of politics is damaging the soul of our
        city – our neighborhoods. I saw this firsthand in my neighborhood with the destruction of the historic St.
        Andrews church building, a political decision made from the top down that excluded community members and left
        our community divided. Unfortunately, we are seeing this model of top-down decision-making across the city,
        leaving many of us to ask: <strong>Where is our voice? Who will stand up in support of our neighborhoods?</strong> Who is
        listening to us?
      </p>
      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        I’m also running in opposition to the proposed sales tax increase, which disproportionately hurts our low-income
        families and individuals. The sales tax (approaching 10%) is also harmful for local businesses, because it
        encourages buyers to go to other cities for shopping. Let’s be clear: <strong>Making basic road maintenance contingent
        upon tax increases is bad governance.</strong> It is unfair to taxpayers and damages our city’s long-term health and
        reputation. I promise to work for a more responsible pathway forward.
      </p>
      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        <strong>St. Paul needs new leadership</strong> – We need real leaders who know our communities, who understand our needs, and who
        can articulate a vision for the future based on values of social inclusion and fiscal responsibility. <strong>I promise
        to be a champion of affordable housing, our public schools, and our environment.</strong> I will also offer a new voice
        to help represent our growing Latino communities, which have historically been left out of our city’s political
        decision-making.
      </p>
      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        <strong>I ask that you consider voting for me on November 7th.</strong> I’ve dedicated my career to public policy and to my
        community. I helped lead the effort to reverse Falcon Heights’ ban on front yard gardening, I was part of the
        successful fight to protect Pig’s Eye Lake from harmful contamination, and I worked alongside my neighbors to
        defend historic buildings across the city. Professionally, I teach political science, specializing in
        environmental politics and Latin American politics. I have also worked as an economic researcher for Poverty
        Action Lab in Santiago, Chile, and as a program evaluator for the MN Office of the Legislator Auditor.
      </p>
      <p class="letter__paragraph">
        <strong>I believe you will see that I am a genuine person, motivated by love for my city, my community, and my
        neighbors.</strong> I look forward to meeting you, hearing from you, and getting to know you. In the meantime, please
        reach out to me at votedavidgs@gmail.com. And most importantly, <strong>mark your calendar for Nov. 7th.</strong>
